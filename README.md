python-progressbar
==================

An almost identical clone of the original python-progressbar by Nilton Volpato,
and available at:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2

This version only differs from the original in that it uses relative package
imports instead of absolute imports, which is necessary for the module to
work under Python 3.3.
